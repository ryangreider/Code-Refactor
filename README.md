The code was re-ordered with comment and spaces.
Each section of the website in the code was separated as "blocks" of code with its own title or comment.

Style.css was ordered in a chronologial way. The code was placed in the same order as the website shows.
(Example: Header
          Content
          Sidebar
          Footer   )

Unnecessary code was deleted and modified fow visual purposes, as "class=seo".
Each block of div was renamed to "section" to specify this was a separated block of code. 
Now the code is a bit cleaner and more understandable. 

Sections and properties for each semantic element is easier to locate with the comments and the chronological order.
